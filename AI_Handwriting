# Handwriting Recognition Project

## Project Overview
This project is designed to accurately recognize handwritten text using a convolutional neural network (CNN). It is implemented in Python using TensorFlow and Keras. The goal is to provide a tool that can convert images of handwritten text into machine-encoded text.

## Features
- **Image Pre-processing:** Converts images to a suitable format for model training.
- **CNN Model:** Utilizes a convolutional neural network to recognize handwritten characters.
- **Accuracy Improvement:** Techniques like data augmentation to improve model accuracy.
- **GUI Application:** A simple graphical user interface for easy interaction with the model.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Libraries
This project depends on several Python libraries. You can install them using pip:
